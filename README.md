# Getting Started

This is single page application that generates two "carousel" interfaces by querying the Star Wars API, parsing the JSON response, and routing a carousel of characters and their information for each Star Wars film in the database. This was originally created as a submission for CyberCube's frontend development test. You can visit the API at https://swapi.dev/.
